# Exercise 1: Cube each number in the list

### Goal

To refactor the [index.js](./index.js) file to use [Array#map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to cube each number in the array provided by the test, removing all references to any in-function state if possible.

### Bonus Points

+ Use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).
+ Use [R.map](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#map) instead.

### Test

```
$ yarn jest exercises/01-cube-numbers
```
