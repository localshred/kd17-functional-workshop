# Exercise 2: Filter Odd Numbers

### Goal

To refactor the [index.js](./index.js) file to use [Array#filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) to filter out even numbers from the array provided by the test, as well as numbers divisible by 8, also removing all references to any in-function state if possible.

### Bonus Points

+ Use [R.filter](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#filter) instead.

### Test

```
$ yarn jest exercises/02-odd-numbers
```
