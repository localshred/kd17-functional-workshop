# Exercise 4: Add 5 to Each Number in a List

### Goal

To refactor the [index.js](./index.js) to utilize currying and partial application for declaring
our intention on how we want to modify each item in the list (via [Ramda's map](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#map) function).

___Tip___: Import the `ramda` library (already a dependency of the app) to get access to one of the most powerful
tools in the functional programmer's arsenal: [R.curry](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#curry).

### Test

```
$ yarn jest exercises/04-map-add
```
